# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Open Source Community Support

Ory Open source software is collaborative and based on contributions by
developers in the Ory community. There is no obligation from Ory to help with
individual problems. If Ory open source software is used in production in a
for-profit company or enterprise environment, we mandate a paid support contract
where Ory is obligated under their service level agreements (SLAs) to offer a
defined level of availability and responsibility. For more information about
paid support please contact us at sales@ory.sh.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[office@ory.sh](mailto:office@ory.sh). All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

the day or night, on weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever
hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.

If you are unsure, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You
won't be yelled at for giving it your best effort. The worst that can happen is
that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of
contributions and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

## Contribute code

Unless you are fixing a known bug, we **strongly** recommend discussing it with
the core team via a GitHub issue or [in our chat](https://www.ory.sh/chat)
before getting started to ensure your work is consistent with Ory Kratos SelfService UI Node Example's
roadmap and architecture.

All contributions are made via pull requests. To make a pull request, you will
need a GitHub account; if you are unclear on this process, see GitHub's
documentation on [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Pull
requests should be targeted at the `master` branch. Before creating a pull
request, go through this checklist:

1. Create a feature branch off of `master` so that changes do not get mixed up.
1. [Rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your local
   changes against the `master` branch.
1. Run the full project test suite with the `go test -tags sqlite ./...` (or
   equivalent) command and confirm that it passes.
1. Run `make format`
1. Add a descriptive prefix to commits. This ensures a uniform commit history
   and helps structure the changelog. Please refer to this
   [Convential Commits configuration](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/blob/master/.github/workflows/conventional_commits.yml)
   for the list of accepted prefixes. You can read more about the Conventional
   Commit specification
   [at their site](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

If a pull request is not ready to be reviewed yet
[it should be marked as a "Draft"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request).

Before your contributions can be reviewed you need to sign our
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node).

This agreement defines the terms under which your code is contributed to Ory.
More specifically it declares that you have the right to, and actually do, grant
us the rights to use your contribution. You can see the Apache 2.0 license under
which our projects are published
[here](https://github.com/ory/meta/blob/master/LICENSE).

When pull requests fail the automated testing stages (for example unit or E2E
tests), authors are expected to update their pull requests to address the
failures until the tests pass.

Pull requests eligible for review

1. follow the repository's code formatting conventions;
2. include tests that prove that the change works as intended and does not add
   regressions;
3. document the changes in the code and/or the project's documentation;
4. pass the CI pipeline;
5. have signed our
   [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node);
6. include a proper git commit message following the
   [Conventional Commit Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

If all of these items are checked, the pull request is ready to be reviewed and
you should change the status to "Ready for review" and
[request review from a maintainer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).

Reviewers will approve the pull request once they are satisfied with the patch.

## Contribute documentation

Please provide documentation when changing, removing, or adding features. All
Ory Documentation resides in the
[Ory documentation repository](https://github.com/ory/docs/). For further
instructions please head over to the Ory Documentation
[README.md](https://github.com/ory/docs/blob/master/README.md).

## Disclosing vulnerabilities

Please disclose vulnerabilities exclusively to
[security@ory.sh](mailto:security@ory.sh). Do not use GitHub issues.

## Code style

Please run `make format` to format all source code following the Ory standard.

### Working with forks

```bash
# First you clone the original repository
git clone git@github.com:ory/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node.git

# Next you add a git remote that is your fork:
git remote add fork git@github.com:<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME-HERE>/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node.git

# Next you fetch the latest changes from origin for master:
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git pull --rebase

# Next you create a new feature branch off of master:
git checkout my-feature-branch

# Now you do your work and commit your changes:
git add -A
git commit -a -m "fix: this is the subject line" -m "This is the body line. Closes #123"

# And the last step is pushing this to your fork
git push -u fork my-feature-branch
```

Now go to the project's GitHub Pull Request page and click "New pull request"

## Conduct

Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this
community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

# Ory Kratos NodeJS / ExpressJS User Interface Reference Implementation

[![tests](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repository contains a reference implementation for Ory Kratos' in NodeJS /
ExpressJS / Handlebars / NextJS. It implements all Ory Kratos flows (login,
registration, account settings, account recovery, account verification).

If you only want to add authentication to your app, and not customize the login,
registration, account recovery, ... screens, please check out the
[Ory Kratos Quickstart](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart).

## Configuration

Below is a list of environment variables required by the Express.js service to
function properly.

In a local development run of the service using `npm run start`, some of these
values will be set by nodemon and is configured by the `nodemon.json` file.

When using this UI with an Ory Network project, you can use `ORY_SDK_URL`
instead of `KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL` and `HYDRA_ADMIN_URL`.

Ory Identities requires the following variables to be set:

- `ORY_SDK_URL` or `KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL` (required): The URL where ORY Kratos's
  Public API is located at. If this app and ORY Kratos are running in the same
  private network, this should be the private network address (e.g.
  `kratos-public.svc.cluster.local`).
- `KRATOS_BROWSER_URL` (optional) The browser accessible URL where ORY Kratos's
  public API is located, only needed if it differs from `KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL`
- `KRATOS_ADMIN_URL` (optional) The URL where Ory Kratos' Admin API is located
  at (e.g. `http://kratos:4434`).

Ory OAuth2 requires more setup to get CSRF cookies on the `/consent` endpoint.

- `ORY_SDK_URL` or `HYDRA_ADMIN_URL` (optional): The URL where Ory Hydra's Admin
  API is located at. If this app and Ory Hydra are running in the same private
  network, this should be the private network address (e.g.
  `hydra-admin.svc.cluster.local`)
- `COOKIE_SECRET` (required): Required for signing cookies. Must be a string
  with at least 8 alphanumerical characters.
- `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` (required): Change the cookie name to match your domain
  using the `__HOST-example.com-x-csrf-token` format.
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECRET` (optional): Required for the Consent route to set a CSRF
  cookie with a hashed value. The value must be a string with at least 8
  alphanumerical characters.
- `REMEMBER_CONSENT_SESSION_FOR_SECONDS` (optional): Sets the `remember_for`
  value of the accept consent request in seconds. The default is 3600 seconds.
- `ORY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (optional): When using with an Ory Network project, you
  should add the `ORY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` for OAuth2 Consent flows.
- `DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_SECURE_CSRF_COOKIES` (optional) This environment
  variables should only be used in local development when you do not have HTTPS
  setup. This sets the CSRF cookies to `secure: false`, required for running
  locally. When using this setting, you must also set `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` to a
  name without the `__Host-` prefix.
- `TRUSTED_CLIENT_IDS` (optional): A list of trusted client ids. They can be set
  to skip the consent screen.

Getting TLS working:

- `TLS_CERT_PATH` (optional): Path to certificate file. Should be set up
  together with `TLS_KEY_PATH` to enable HTTPS.
- `TLS_KEY_PATH` (optional): Path to key file Should be set up together with
  `TLS_CERT_PATH` to enable HTTPS.

This is the easiest mode as it requires no additional set up. This app runs on
port `:4455` and ORY Kratos `KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL` URL.

This mode relies on the browser's ability to send cookies regardless of the
port. Cookies set for `127.0.0.1:4433` will thus also be sent when requesting
`127.0.0.1:4455`. For environments where applications run on separate
subdomains, check out
[Multi-Domain Cookies](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/guides/multi-domain-cookies)

To authenticate incoming requests, this app uses ORY Kratos' `whoami` API to
check whether the session is valid or not.

### Base Path

There are two ways of serving this application under a base path:

1. Let Express.js handle the routing by setting the `BASE_PATH` environment
   variable to the sub-path, e.g. `/myapp`.
2. Use a reverse proxy or API gateway to strip the path prefix.

The second approach is not always possible, especially when running the
application on a serverless environment. In this case, the first approach is
recommended.

## Development

To run this app with dummy data and no real connection to ORY Kratos, use:

```shell script
NODE_ENV=stub npm start
```

If you would like to also generate fake data for the `id_token`, please set the
environment varialbe `export CONFORMITY_FAKE_CLAIMS=1`

### Test with ORY Kratos

The easiest way to test this app with a local installation of ORY Kratos is to
have the [ORY Kratos Quickstart](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart/)
running. This is what that would look like:

```shell script
# start the quickstart using docker compose as explained in the tutorial: https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart/
export KRATOS_PUBLIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4433/
export PORT=4455

# In ORY Kratos run the quickstart:
#
#   make quickstart-dev
#
# Next you need to kill the docker container that runs this app in order to free the ports:
#
#   docker kill kratos_kratos-selfservice-ui-node_1

npm start
```

### Update TypeScript SDK

If you've made changes to the ORY Kratos API you may want to manually generate
the TypeScript SDK in order for URLs and payloads to work as expected. It is
expected that you start this guide from this project's root, wherever you
checked it out. You also need to have the
[`openapi-generator` installed](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation).

```shell script
# Set path to kratos:
export KRATOS_DIR=/path/to/kratos
make build-sdk
```

#### Building the Docker Image

```shell script
# Set path to kratos:
export KRATOS_DIR=/path/to/kratos
make build-sdk-docker
```

#### Clean up

```shell script
make clean-sdk
```

        Thank you for writing this design document. 

        One of the key elements of Ory's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. These are relatively informal documents that the primary author or authors of a software system or application create before they embark on the coding project. The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.

        Ory is leaning heavily on [Google's design docs process](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/)
        and [Golang Proposals](https://github.com/golang/proposal).

        Writing a design doc before contributing your change ensures that your ideas are checked with
        the community and maintainers. It will save you a lot of time developing things that might need to be changed
        after code reviews, and your pull requests will be merged faster.

        A short list of bullet points of what the goals of the system are, and, sometimes more importantly, what non-goals are. Note, that non-goals arenâ€™t negated goals like â€œThe system shouldnâ€™t crashâ€, but rather things that could reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. A good example would be â€œACID complianceâ€; when designing a database, youâ€™d certainly want to know whether that is a goal or non-goal. And if it is a non-goal you might still select a solution that provides it, if it doesnâ€™t introduce trade-offs that prevent achieving the goals.

        This section should start with an overview and then go into details.
        The design doc is the place to write down the trade-offs you made in designing your software. Focus on those trade-offs to produce a useful document with long-term value. That is, given the context (facts), goals and non-goals (requirements), the design doc is the place to suggest solutions and show why a particular solution best satisfies those goals.

        The point of writing a document over a more formal medium is to provide the flexibility to express the problem at hand in an appropriate manner. Because of this, there is no explicit guidance on how to actually describe the design.

        If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of date. Instead, focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.

        Systems that store data should likely discuss how and in what rough form this happens. Similar to the advice on APIs, and for the same reasons, copy-pasting complete schema definitions should be avoided. Instead, focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its trade-offs.

        Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to prototypes that show the feasibility of the design.

        One of the primary factors that would influence the shape of a software design and hence the design doc, is the degree of constraint of the solution space.

        On one end of the extreme is the â€œgreenfield software projectâ€, where all we know are the goals, and the solution can be whatever makes the most sense. Such a document may be wide-ranging, but it also needs to quickly define a set of rules that allow zooming in on a manageable set of solutions.

        On the other end are systems where the possible solutions are very well defined, but it isn't at all obvious how they could even be combined to achieve the goals. This may be a legacy system that is difficult to change and wasn't designed to do what you want it to do or a library design that needs to operate within the constraints of the host programming language.

        In this situation, you may be able to enumerate all the things you can do relatively easily, but you need to creatively put those things together to achieve the goals. There may be multiple solutions, and none of them are great, and hence such a document should focus on selecting the best way given all identified trade-offs.

        This section lists alternative designs that would have reasonably achieved similar outcomes. The focus should be on the trade-offs that each respective design makes and how those trade-offs led to the decision to select the design that is the primary topic of the document.

        While it is fine to be succinct about a solution that ended up not being selected, this section is one of the most important ones as it shows very explicitly why the selected solution is the best given the project goals and how other solutions, that the reader may be wondering about, introduce trade-offs that are less desirable given the goals.

            Hello contributors!

            I am marking this issue as stale as it has not received any engagement from the community or maintainers for a year. That does not imply that the issue has no merit! If you feel strongly about this issue

            - open a PR referencing and resolving the issue;
            - leave a comment on it and discuss ideas on how you could contribute towards resolving it;
            - leave a comment and describe in detail why this issue is critical for your use case;
            - open a new issue with updated details and a plan for resolving the issue.

            Throughout its lifetime, Ory has received over 10.000 issues and PRs. To sustain that growth, we need to prioritize and focus on issues that are important to the community. A good indication of importance, and thus priority, is activity on a topic.

            Unfortunately, [burnout](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/why-i-close-prs-oss-project-maintainer-notes) has become a [topic](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/#its-okay-to-hit-pause) of [concern](https://docs.brew.sh/Maintainers-Avoiding-Burnout) amongst open-source projects.

            It can lead to severe personal and health issues as well as [opening](https://haacked.com/archive/2019/05/28/maintainer-burnout/) catastrophic [attack vectors](https://www.gradiant.org/en/blog/open-source-maintainer-burnout-as-an-attack-surface/).

            The motivation for this automation is to help prioritize issues in the backlog and not ignore, reject, or belittle anyone.

            If this issue was marked as stale erroneously you can exempt it by adding the `backlog` label, assigning someone, or setting a milestone for it.

            Thank you for your understanding and to anyone who participated in the conversation! And as written above, please do participate in the conversation if this topic is important to you!

            Thank you ðŸ™âœŒï¸

Adjust this in the configuration!\n`browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.\nMost likely used in Social Sign In flows.\n\nMore information can be found at [Ory Kratos User Login](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/self-service/flows/user-login) and [User Registration Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/self-service/flows/user-registration).",
